# Machine Learning Lifecycle
I employed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology in this project. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/CRISP-DM.png" width="500">
</p>

Here are the steps I undertook:

## Business Understanding:

I began by understanding the problem domain, which involved predicting income levels.
I defined the project goals and objectives, such as addressing income inequality through data-driven insights.

## Data Understanding:
I collected the dataset from [your_data_source_link], which included various income-related attributes. After an overview of the first few columns, I formulated hypotheses and key analytical questions that would guide the understanding of the dataset.

**Hypothesis:** 
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant association between the individual's age and income level.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant association between the individual's age and income level.

**Key

 Analytical Questions:** 

- i. Are there any correlations or patterns between numerical features (e.g., age, education) and income levels?

- ii. How does the distribution of key numerical variables (e.g., age) differ between income categories?

- iii. Is there a relationship between education level and income?

I understand your concern. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in our conversation. I apologize for any confusion.

## Project Overview:
This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict income levels, addressing the challenges of income inequality and providing insights for policymakers.

### Business Understanding
- Gained a deep understanding of income inequality.
- Defined objectives and set the F1 score as the evaluation metric.

### Data Understanding
- Loaded and explored provided datasets, including variable descriptions and relationships.

### Data Preparation
- Preprocessed data by handling missing values and anomalies.
- Performed feature engineering.

### Modeling
- Selected and trained ML classification algorithms on the training dataset to predict income.

### Evaluation
- Assessed model performance using the F1 score, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Deployment
- Deployed the model for prediction on the test dataset through Streamlit and FAST API with Docker and Hugging Face.

## Dataset Overview
The train dataset contained 209,499 rows and 43 columns. The test dataset has 89,786 rows and 42 columns.

## Missing Values
Significant missing data in both the train and test datasets. Columns with more than 70% missing values were dropped.

## Hypothesis Testing
Performed a chi-square test for education levels and income categories, revealing a statistically significant association between education levels and income categories.

### Does a higher education level correspond to a higher likelihood of having incomes above the threshold?

The dataset exhibits substantial income inequality, especially at lower education tiers, but higher education is positively correlated with income. Income inequality persists even at higher education levels, suggesting that other factors also contribute to income inequality.

### How does age relate to income levels in the dataset?

Lower-income individuals are younger on average than higher-income individuals, but there is a broader age range in the higher-income group. Older individuals are more likely to have incomes above the threshold, and the higher-income group has a more diverse age distribution.

### Is there a significant gender-based income disparity?

Women are more likely to be below the income threshold than men, indicating a significant gender disparity in income levels.

### Are there differences in employment status between the two income groups?

Income inequality is present across all employment statuses, with individuals in full-time schedules, part-time roles, and unemployment facing financial challenges.

### How do race and ethnicity correlate with income levels in the dataset?

Racial income disparities exist, with White individuals having a higher count above the income threshold than other racial groups. Citizens have a more diverse income distribution than foreigners.

### Is citizenship status associated with income levels?

The majority of foreigners in the dataset are concentrated below the income threshold, indicating a potential association between foreign status and lower income levels.

### What is the relationship between occupation and income categories?

The majority of individuals with income below the threshold are in occupations categorized as "Unknown," indicating potential associations between specific occupations and higher income levels.

### How does tax status correspond to income levels?

Nonfilers seem to have a disproportionately higher representation in the below-income threshold category, indicating a potential income disparity among nonfilers.

## Feature Engineering
Performed unique value exploration, column renaming, missing value imputation, column dropping, target column extraction, and balancing the target column to address class imbalance.

## Encoding Categorical Variables
Identified and encoded categorical variables using the OrdinalEncoder, ensuring effective utilization of the data in predictive tasks.

## Modeling: Dataset Splitting
Split the preprocessed training dataset into training and evaluation sets (80% training, 20% evaluation) using train_test_split.

## Modeling: Feature Scaling
Scaled numerical features using Min-Max scaling to ensure consistent scale and prevent certain features from dominating the learning process.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Utilized the CatBoost Classifier for its automatic categorical feature handling, handling of missing values, streamlined feature scaling, built-in cross-validation, and regularization techniques. Achieved an Accuracy of 89.38% and an F1-Score of 0.89.

## Saving The Model and Key Components
Saved the model, unique values, encoder, and scaler in a single pickle file for later use.

## App Architecture
Utilized Streamlit for a user-friendly interface and FAST API for scalable predictions. The architecture allows for flexibility in deployment, scalability, high performance, and easy integration.

## Why Streamlit + FastAPI?
- Asynchronous processing
- Scalability
- High performance
- Easy integration

Streamlit allows for a user-friendly interface, while FastAPI ensures scalability and high performance for global-scale predictions.

## Linking The Streamlit App with The FASTAPI
Connected the Streamlit app with the FastAPI backend for seamless integration. Sent a POST request to the FastAPI server, obtained the prediction response, and displayed the prediction result to the user.

## App Layout - Homepage, Solution & EDA
The app comprises four pages: Homepage, Solution, EDA, and Prediction Page. Each page serves a specific purpose, from introducing the user to the problem to providing a PowerBI dashboard and allowing for predictions.

## App Layout - Prediction Page
The Prediction Page allows users to input data such as age, gender, education, etc. They submit the data and receive an instant prediction response. The page provides descriptions of the different inputs and allows users to view and select them.

## FastAPI Backend
The FastAPI backend accepts user input data, preprocesses it, utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict income categories, calculates prediction probability, formats the prediction result, and returns the prediction response.
